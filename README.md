# rancher-kuberlr
A simple way to invoke the correct [kubectl](https://github.com/rancher/kubectl) version on a Rancher managed cluster using [kuberlr](https://github.com/flavio/kuberlr).

## Artifacts of this repo
This repo produces:
- Base generic kuberlr images `mallardduck/rancher-kuberlr:base-{version}` (matching [kuberlr](https://github.com/flavio/kuberlr) versions 1:1),
  - This is simply a container with `kuberlr` binary in it.
- Rancher specific kuberlr `mallardduck/rancher-kuberlr:{version}`.
  - This container is analogous to the current `rancher/kubectl` container, but based on [kuberlr](https://github.com/flavio/kuberlr)
  - Unlike `rancher/kubectl` the kubler image targets specific Rancher minor release.
  - Each release pre-bundles all [kubectl](https://github.com/rancher/kubectl) versions supported by the Rancher version the release supports.

## Branches, Releases, and Rancher
| branch           | Release | Rancher |
|------------------|---------|---------|
| (default branch) |base-v0.Y.Z|n/a|
| release/v2.9     |v2.Y.Z|2.9.Z|
| release/v2.8     |v1.Y.Z|2.8.Z|

### Notes:
- The workflows for the base images of kuberlr have to live in the `default branch`, over time this changes (currently `release/v2.9`).
- It could go live upstream in the [kuberlr](https://github.com/flavio/kuberlr) repo - but this is easy enough to do.
- Each minor Rancher release will get a kubler image tag major to match it.
  - This gives us full "Y" and "Z" control on versioning the component to target Rancher minors.
  - E.x. Rancher 2.8.x releases will get varying versions of 1.Y.Z

### Compatability

Each "kuberlr base image" will be essentially universially compatible like kuberlr is.
However they were match each `kuberlr` release and subsequently `rancher-kuberlr` will be based on those.

So when a new `kuberlr` releases our automation will add the tag to the versions file via PR.
Then upon merge another workflow will build and release new base images tagged matching that new version.
After which, the `rancher-kuberlr` images will need a PR to update those to use the new `kuberlr`.
And once ready to release new RCs can be created that will ship the new kuberlr.

        1.30              :29,31
```

Note: Over-time, as new `kuberlr` binaries are released we can introduce a new base image based on that.  
Then we can still subsequently bump the Y or Z of that "rancher kuberlr" release to update all supported Rancher releases.
